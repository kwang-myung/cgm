See [Continous Glucose Monitoring: Start Here](http://richardsprague.com/notes/continuous-glucose-monitoring/)

I've been tracking my glucose levels 24 x 7 using a continuous glucose monitor from Abbott Labs called the [Freestyle Libre](https://www.freestylelibre.us/index.html). 

View a Shiny version of my current data at [https://personalscience.shinyapps.io/librelink/](https://personalscience.shinyapps.io/librelink/).  [[Source](https://github.com/richardsprague/cgm/tree/master/librelink)]

Read (and edit!) my [Continuous Glucose Monitoring Hackers Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DFx0E-ZQ-r_D1SqXvMtvkDCjx6j7NevrE43WSaKyJE/edit?usp=sharing) for details for how to get started, plus as many resources as I know about other apps and links that you might find useful for beginning your own CGM analysis.

This is a short R script I use for my analysis.  (also available as an R Package: [cgmr](https://github.com/richardsprague/cgm/tree/master/cgmr))

---

## Prerequisites

Besides the working sensor, to run this script you'll need:

* A registered account on Freestyle's official site: [libreview.com](https://www2.libreview.com/)
* Data downloaded from the Libreview site.  (I download it and convert to XLSX format in the file "Librelink.xlsx")
* A separate activity file to register your food, exercise, sleep, and other events. (Another XLSX file I call "Activity.XLSX")

See examples of all my raw data files in the [librelink](https://github.com/richardsprague/cgm/tree/master/librelink) directory.

One you have downloaded the raw Librelink data and created the activity file, you must read the results into two dataframes:

`libre_raw` : the raw output from a Librelink CSV file. You could just read.csv straight from the CSV if you like.

`activity_raw`: your file containing the metadata about whatever you'd like to track. The following script assumes you'll have variables for `Sleep`, `Exercise`, `Food`, and a catch-all called `Event`. 


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

source("read_cgm_data.R")
```

Now clean up the data and then set up a few other useful variables. Be careful about time zones: the raw data comes as UTC time, so you'll need to convert everything to your local time zone if you want the following charts to match.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggthemes)

activity_raw$Start <- activity_raw$Start %>% lubridate::parse_date_time(order = "ymd HMS",tz = "US/Pacific")
activity_raw$End <- activity_raw$End %>% lubridate::parse_date_time(order = "ymd HMS", tz = "US/Pacific")


glucose <- libre_raw %>% select(time = "Meter Timestamp", 
                                scan = "Scan Glucose(mg/dL)",
                                hist = "Historic Glucose(mg/dL)",
                                strip = "Strip Glucose(mg/dL)",
                                food = "Notes")

#glucose$time <- readr::parse_datetime(libre_raw$`Meter Timestamp`,locale = locale(tz="US/Pacific"))

glucose$time <- as_datetime(libre_raw$`Meter Timestamp`, tz = "US/Pacific")
# 
glucose$value <- dplyr::if_else(is.na(glucose$scan),glucose$hist,glucose$scan)

# apply correction for faulty 2019-01-08 sensor
#glucose$value <- dplyr::if_else(glucose$time>as_datetime("2019-01-08"),glucose$value+35,glucose$value)

# apply correction for faulty 2019-03-24 sensor
#glucose$value <- dplyr::if_else(glucose$time>as_datetime("2019-03-23"),glucose$value+35,glucose$value)


glucose_raw <- glucose

# libre_raw$`Meter Timestamp` %>% lubridate::parse_date_time(order = "ymd HMS",tz = "US/Pacific")
```

Set up a few convenience functions.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(cgmr) # loads my private package that includes all the functions for analysis

```



View the last couple days of the dataset:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

startDate <- now() - days(2) #min(glucose$time)

#cgm_display(startDate,now()-days(6))

cgm_display(startDate,startDate + days(2))
```

Here's just for a single day. Note that the commented-out lines will let you output to a PDF file if you like.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}



#pdf("icecream.pdf", width = 11, height = 8.5)
cgm_display(start = min(glucose_raw$time),min(glucose_raw$time)+hours(24))
#dev.off()

```


The final full day of the dataset:

```{r lastestCGMResult, warning = FALSE}
cgm_start_plot(startTime = max(glucose_raw$time)-days(1), timeLength = 24, title = "Latest Full Day")
```


## Food types


I measured myself while trying various foods. Click [here](food_effects.md) to see the results.


## Basic Statistics

What is my average glucose level while sleeping?

```{r}
library(lubridate)

options(scipen = 999)

# all sleep intervals, using the lubridate function lubridate::interval
# sleep_intervals <- interval(activity_raw %>% dplyr::filter(Activity == "Sleep") %>% select(Start)
#                             %>% unlist() %>% as_datetime(),
#                             activity_raw %>% dplyr::filter(Activity == "Sleep") %>% select(End) 
#                             %>% unlist() %>% as_datetime())

activity_intervals <- function(activity_raw_df, activity_name){
  interval(activity_raw_df %>% dplyr::filter(Activity == activity_name) %>% select(Start)
                            %>% unlist() %>% as_datetime(),
                            activity_raw_df %>% dplyr::filter(Activity ==activity_name) %>% select(End) 
                            %>% unlist() %>% as_datetime())
}


# 
# glucose %>% dplyr::filter(apply(sapply(glucose$time,
#                                 function(x) x %within% activity_intervals(activity_raw,"Sleep")),2,any)) %>% select(value) %>% 
#   DescTools::Desc(main = "Glucose Values While Sleeping")

# glucose %>% filter(apply(sapply(glucose$time,
#                                 function(x) !(x %within% activity_intervals(activity_raw,"Sleep"))),
#                          2,
#                          any)) %>% select(value) %>% 
#   DescTools::Desc(main = "Glucose Values While Awake")



# glucose %>% filter(apply(sapply(glucose$time,
#                                 function(x) x %within% activity_intervals(activity_raw,"Exercise")),2,any)) %>% select(value) %>% 
#   DescTools::Desc(main = "Glucose Values While Exercising")


```
